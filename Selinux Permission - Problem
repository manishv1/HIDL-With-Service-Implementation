Manually start native service server on android device with the following steps:
adb root
adb remount
adb push native_server /system/bin/
adb shell setenforce 0
adb shell
cd /system/bin and execute chmod 777 native_server
execute ./native_server to start native service

Sometimes app can not connect to native service due to selinux permission problem. The step 6 setenforce 0 above used to put selinux in permissive mode and close selinux temporarily.
When native_server is running you can install and start app to connect it
